### R Programming Assignment 2

This is an assignment on lexical scoping, and see how it works in R. It helped me to understand how to pass values to different environments/scopes.

### Issues

There are no programming issues, but the instructions are unclear about adding one separate file to show how the functions are implemented, I added it to the `code.R` file.
